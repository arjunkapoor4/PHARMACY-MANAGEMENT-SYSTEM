Pharmacy Management System (C++ | Windows CMD)

This project is a comprehensive Pharmacy Management System built using C++ and designed to run in the Windows Command Prompt (CMD). It provides a text-based interface for managing pharmacy operations such as:

Medicine Management: Add, modify, delete, and view medicine records.

Staff Management: Manage staff details, salaries, and roles.

Order Tracking: Handle pending and completed medicine orders.

Supplier Directory: Add and manage supplier contact details.

Expense Monitoring: Track electricity, travel, purchase, and salary expenses.

Patient Records: Maintain patient profiles with disease and contact data.

Login System: Secure access with a simple username/password mechanism.

Data is stored in structured text files, and the system uses file handling extensively to simulate a basic database. This project demonstrates practical use of object-oriented programming, file I/O, and console UI design in C++.
